Setting up the Django environment was a series of obstacles and growth. The first challenge was downloading the wrong version of Python, which caused issues with the installation. After troubleshooting the installation problems, I removed an old version of Python and successfully updated my version of Python, and installed Django in a virtual environment. Once I opened VS Code, I forgot to select the proper interpreter for my venv, which caused Django commands to be invalid. I was able to resolve this by selecting the proper interpreter. When I went to run the server, I was running into migration issue until I ran python manage.py migrate, which cleared the errors. Additionally, it took longer than I estimated to set up my remote project in GitHub, as I was unclear how to set my remote origin. After following what GitHub instructed, I was able to push code to my repository. All of these experiences taught me the importance of version control, debugging, and environment setup. I feel like I have developed greater skills with using Django, managing the project in VS Code, and utilizing GitHub.
